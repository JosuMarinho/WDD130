          <img src="images/Project1.png" alt="Descripción del proyecto 1">
          <p>The project consisted of developing the interface of a safe transportation mobile application
             for a municipal government, my goal was to create an attractive and user-friendly experience. I achieved this by selecting a cohesive color palette, 
             incorporating clear icons for easy navigation, and optimizing the application for quick loading and seamless operation on any device. 
	     <br> </br>	  
	     Additionally,I conducted testing with real users to obtain valuable feedback that allowed me to make improvements and adjustments prior to launch.
             <br> </br>
	     The end result was a successful and well-received application that reflects the brand of the municipal government and enhances the experience of its citizens. 
             I am proud of my work on this project and excited to see how it will positively impact the community.</p>

          <h3>Corporative brand</h3>
          <img src="images/Project2.png" alt="Descripción del proyecto 2">
          <p>In this project I worked on a corporate web design project for an accounting company. 
             The goal was to create a professional online presence that reflected the company's values 
             and personality while providing an engaging user experience. 
             <br> </br>
             I designed a cohesive logo 
             and visual elements, selected a color palette that conveyed the brand and atmosphere, 
             and ensured the website was fully responsive and optimized for fast loading on any device.
             <br> </br>
             The end result was a high-quality corporate web design that reflects the professionalism 
             and dedication of the accounting company to its clients. I'm proud of my work on this project 
             and excited to see how it will help the company establish a strong online presence.</p>
