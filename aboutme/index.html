        <p>My name is Josu Del Angel and I consider myself to be an eternal apprentice. This is because I am always looking to better understand how things work and why we think the way we do.<p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for more than 30 years.I'm originally from Mexico, and I have a beautiful family made up of my wife and daughter.<p></p>We all love to cook and especially describe and prepare delicious dishes, whether it's a national or an international recipe.</p> 
        <p>I am a universitary teacher and a passionate about technology, thank you for taking the time to visit my website.</p>
